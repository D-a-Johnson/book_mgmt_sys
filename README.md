The purpose of the management system was to have some way for users to check out books. The initial idea was to allow each user individually to check out books through their account while fulfilling the assignment's requirements. 

I had the idea that the assignment wanted just a general interface with no user log-in but was unsure so I went with varient as I can remove the accounts more easily than adding them. All information that was wanted can be accessed from the user's page or through the console.

Goals:
--IMPORTANT-- Book history of income and who checked out the book
Splash page to log-in to the index which would include all information and pop up boxes.
An admin page to control it all and display all information.
Get rid of user avatars or find a way to repurpose them
Disallow users from checking out the same book more than once.
Not allow users to checkout books if the sum of the cost of currently checked out books exceeds their balance
